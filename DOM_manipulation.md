Here are a few exercises for creating and manipulating DOM elements, suitable for teaching JavaScript students. Each exercise builds on core concepts, gradually increasing in complexity.

---

### **Exercise 1: Create and Add Elements**
1. Create a `div` element with the text "Hello, DOM!".
2. Add a class of `greeting` to the `div`.
3. Append the `div` to the body of the document.

**Expected Result**: A `div` with the text "Hello, DOM!" appears in the browser.

---

### **Exercise 2: Style an Element**
1. Select the `div` you created in Exercise 1.
2. Change its background color to lightblue.
3. Set its text color to darkblue and add some padding (e.g., `10px`).

**Expected Result**: The `div` should now have a lightblue background, darkblue text, and padding.

---

### **Exercise 3: Create a List**
1. Create an unordered list (`ul`) and append it to the body.
2. Using a loop, create and append 5 `li` elements to the `ul`.
3. Set the text of each `li` to "Item 1", "Item 2", ..., "Item 5".

**Expected Result**: A list with 5 items is displayed.

---

### **Exercise 4: Event Listener**
1. Add a button with the text "Click Me" to the body.
2. Add an event listener to the button that logs "Button Clicked!" to the console when it is clicked.

**Expected Result**: Clicking the button logs a message to the console.

---

### **Exercise 5: Delete an Element**
1. Add another button with the text "Remove Item".
2. Add an event listener to the button that removes the last `li` from the list created in Exercise 3.

**Expected Result**: Clicking the "Remove Item" button removes the last item from the list.

---

### **Exercise 6: Input and Output**
1. Add a text input (`input`) and a button with the text "Add Item" to the body.
2. When the button is clicked, get the value from the input field and add it as a new `li` to the list.
3. Clear the input field after adding the item.

**Expected Result**: Users can add new items to the list by typing in the input field and clicking the button.

---

### **Exercise 7: Modify Existing Elements**
1. Create a `p` element with some placeholder text and append it to the body.
2. Add a button with the text "Change Text".
3. When the button is clicked, change the text of the `p` element to "The text has been changed!".

**Expected Result**: Clicking the button updates the paragraph text.

---

### **Exercise 8: Toggle Classes**
1. Add a `div` with some text and a class of `box`. Style `.box` in your CSS to have a visible border and some padding.
2. Add a button with the text "Toggle Highlight".
3. When the button is clicked, toggle a class of `highlight` on the `div`. Style `.highlight` to change the background color of the `div`.

**Expected Result**: Clicking the button toggles the background color of the `div`.

---

### **Exercise 9: Dynamic Table**
1. Create a button labeled "Add Row".
2. Create a table with a header row (e.g., "Name", "Age").
3. When the button is clicked, add a new row to the table with dummy data.

**Expected Result**: Each click adds a new row to the table.

---

### **Exercise 10: Interactive Counter**
1. Add a `span` to display a number (starting at 0).
2. Add two buttons: "Increase" and "Decrease".
3. When "Increase" is clicked, increment the number in the `span`. When "Decrease" is clicked, decrement the number.

**Expected Result**: The number updates dynamically when the buttons are clicked.

These exercises can be completed in sequence or independently and are designed to reinforce DOM manipulation concepts, such as creating, appending, modifying, and deleting elements, as well as handling events and dynamic updates.
